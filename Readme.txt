The motivation for this project was to create a hangman game based on topics of IT.

To run.

Open index.html

To guess a letter, click any letter.

The game will tell you how many guesses you have left.

Once you have clicked a letter it becomes disabled. 

If you run out of guesses you have lost and the game prompts you to play again

to play again click 'Play Again'

If you won, the game will tell you.

As usual click 'play again' to reset
